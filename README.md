# School_District_Analysis

## Sumarry of Findings 
### Purpose of Analysis
- The Purpose of this analysis was to present the data on the Pycity schools in order to make assesmenets as to preformance in key areas such as math and reading in their standardized testing 
### Analysis Summary
- In looking at the data it was important to compile it in order to be to see the trends in prefrmance among the seveal thousand student and multiple schools. To accomplish this it was important to import and read the data in the CSV and then use the functions of `loc` `iloc` and `groupby` in order to properly present the data as these functionsallowed for the presenting of specific parts of the data and as such served to present the scores and which schools they came from. This locating of specific parts of the data was further helped with functions such as `describe` which was a quick way to create sumarries for impotant parts of the data set and present the overall trends and averages in the data. 
- As for the analysis of the data itself it showed no major trends in favor of chter or public schools in terms of performance except in the case of reading scores in the 11th grade charter which are signifigantly higher on average than any other scores. As for other trends in the data there is a clear difference in math and reading scores as on average the math scores were around 10 points lower outside of grades 9 and 10 in the charter schools implying better teaching during those early charter school grades.
### Possible Further Analysis 
- As for possible further analysis it would possibly be of benefit in coming to conclusions on the data if more data was presented in breaking down the scores by the different specific schools in order to check for how specific schools are affecting the average and if there is any variation in those trends between charter and public.
